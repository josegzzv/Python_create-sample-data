# School Database with SQLite3 and Faker

This project creates a school database using SQLite3 in Python, populated with fictional data generated by the Faker library. The database includes information about students, courses, grades, and attendance, and is designed for practicing data cleaning and advanced data handling techniques.

## Features

- **10 Courses**: Each with a unique name and description.
- **1000 Students**: With names, ages, and email addresses, some of which are missing to allow for data cleaning exercises.
- **5000 Grades**: Randomly assigned to students for various courses.
- **100,000 Attendance Records**: Tracking how many classes each student attended, with some missing values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SQLite3 library (included by default in Python)
- Faker library

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the Faker library if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install faker
   ```
## Usage

Create the Database:
Run the create_school_database.py script to generate the SQLite database (escuela.db) with the fictional data:
```bash
python create_school_database.py
```
The script will populate the database with 10 courses, 1000 students, 5000 grades, and 100,000 attendance records.

## Explore the Database:
You can connect to the escuela.db database using any SQLite client or via Python using sqlite3.
Run Data Cleaning and Advanced Data Handling Exercises:
Use the provided scripts or create your own to practice data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and combining data from multiple tables.
### Exercises

#### Data Cleaning

1. Identify Missing Values: Identify records with missing values in the students, grades, and attendance tables.
2. Impute Missing Data: Fill in missing student ages with the median age and replace missing attendance records with 0.

#### Advanced Data Handling

1. Filter Data: Find students with grades greater than 8 in any course.
2. Group and Calculate: Compute the average grade for each course.
3. Combine Data: Identify students with fewer than 5 attendances in any course.
